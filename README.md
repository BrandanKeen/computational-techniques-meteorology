# Computational Techniques in Meteorology

This repository contains coursework completed for the *Computational Techniques in Meteorology* course. It showcases the use of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and scientific libraries such as `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `pandas` for data analysis and visualization in meteorological and climatological contexts.

Each assignment folder includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Supporting plots and figures (`.png`)
- A short `README.md` describing the assignment and methods used
