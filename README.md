# Computational Techniques in Meteorology

This repository contains coursework completed for the *Computational Techniques in Meteorology* course. It showcases the use of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and scientific libraries such as `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `pandas` for data analysis and visualization in meteorological and climatological contexts.

Each assignment folder includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Supporting plots and figures (`.png`)
- A short `README.md` describing the assignment and methods used

## Assignments

- [Assignment 04](assignment04) â€“ Time Series and Bar Chart Visualization
- [Assignment 05](assignment05) â€“ SST Anomalies and Topographic Visualization
- [Assignment 06](assignment06) â€“ Climatological Comparison of U.S. Cities (2022 vs. 1991â€“2020)
- [Assignment 07](assignment07) â€“ Atmospheric Sounding Visualization with Skew-T
- [Assignment 08](assignment08) â€“ Visualization of GOES-16 RGB, 300K Isentropic Fields, and Gridded MSLP from Surface Data
- [Assignment 09](assignment09) â€“ Synoptic-scale analysis using 300 hPa wind fields and 850â€“1000 hPa thickness
