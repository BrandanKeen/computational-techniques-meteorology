# Assignment 07 â€“ Atmospheric Sounding Visualization with Skew-T

This assignment processes a raw radiosonde observation from the Springfield, MO (KSGF) station and generates a Skew-T log-p diagram for 12Z on June 12, 2004. The output includes parcel diagnostics such as LCL, LFC, EL, CAPE, and CIN.

## Included Files
- `assignment7_Keen.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for processing and plotting the Skew-T diagram
- `SGF_20040612_12.txt`: Raw sounding data from Wyoming Weather Archive
- `SGF_20040612_12.png`: Final Skew-T plot with temperature, dew point, winds, and stability indices

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Reading and cleaning raw atmospheric sounding data
- Generating Skew-T plots with MetPy
- Extracting key thermodynamic indices (LCL, LFC, EL, CAPE, CIN)
- Overlaying wind barbs and hodographs
