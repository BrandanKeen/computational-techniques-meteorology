# Assignment 08 â€“ Isentropic and Synoptic Analysis of a Cyclone Event

This analysis includes:
- GOES-16 RGB airmass imagery with 300K isentropic pressure and wind overlays
- A full-CONUS map of mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) based on surface station observations
- A high-resolution, zoomed-in MSLP analysis of Hurricane Helene

## Included Files
- `assignment8_Keen.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with Python code for data processing and plotting
- `CONUS_east_300K_RGB_Isentropic_Surface_20241120_06.png`: GOES-16 airmass RGB with isentropic contours and wind barbs at 300K
- `MSLP_Obs_2024_09_27_03.png`: Full CONUS surface pressure field showing synoptic-scale structure
- `Hurricane_Helene_MSLP_Obs_2024_09_27_03.png`: Zoomed-in MSLP contour map of Hurricane Helene's central pressure pattern

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Visualization of GOES-16 RGB airmass imagery using `xarray`, `matplotlib`, and `cartopy`
- Overlaying isentropic pressure surfaces and wind barbs on satellite imagery
- Contouring MSLP fields using station data and isoline smoothing techniques
- Subsetting and masking meteorological datasets for focused regional analysis
- Integrating geospatial and synoptic data in Python for professional-quality diagnostics
