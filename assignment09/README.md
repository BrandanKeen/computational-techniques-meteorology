# Assignment 09 – Synoptic-scale analysis using 300 hPa wind fields to examine jet streaks and 850–1000 hPa thickness

Synoptic-scale analysis using 300 hPa wind fields to examine jet streaks and 850–1000 hPa thickness with geopotential heights to assess baroclinicity and thermal structure.

## Included Files
- `assignment09_Keen.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data processing and plotting code
- `Question1_Keen.png`: 300 hPa analysis including heights, isotachs, and wind barbs
- `Question2_Keen.png`: 850–1000 hPa thickness with 850 and 1000 hPa geopotential heights

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Interpretation of jet stream structure and isotach gradients at 300 hPa
- Contour overlay techniques to visualize vertical structure of the atmosphere
- Use of line styling, color maps, and map projections for multi-layer atmospheric analysis
- Integration of dynamic (wind) and thermodynamic (thickness) diagnostics in synoptic meteorology
