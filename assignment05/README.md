# Assignment 05 – SST Anomalies and Topographic Visualization

This assignment combines global and regional visualization using Python. It includes a global sea surface temperature (SST) map, SST anomaly progression during the 1997 El Niño event, and a topographic map of Colorado.

## Included Files
- `assignment5_Keen.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all three visualizations
- `sst_anomalies_Keen.png`: Monthly SST anomalies across 1997 using a climatological baseline
- `global_sst_Keen.png`: Global SST map from September 22, 1997
- `colorado_topo_Keen.png`: Topographic relief of Colorado with major cities labeled

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Subplot creation and custom layout formatting
- Use of colormaps and colorbars in climate data
- Geographic data plotting with Cartopy and Matplotlib
